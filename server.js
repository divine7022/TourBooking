///  MONGODB:
// 1) here we first installed the mongoess driver. from the vs code terminal.
// connect is a method we are calling on the mongooes variable.
// here while connecting first argument will be connection string which is in config.env and second argument we should give some options to deal with deprication warnings. Always we should use the exact same syntax.
// the .connect() method will return a promice we should handle that using "then". then it will get a connection object which we are calling here as a "con"

//  .connect(process.env.DATABASE_LOCAL, { --> in case if we want to connect to local database then insterd of database string("DB") use the above given local database varibale which is defied in the config.env
// if we want to use the hosted database then use then use the database string variable defined in the config.env

// required: true, --> means it is like saying this field is required ,this field should compulsory while input.
// name: {
//  type: String,
//  required: [true, "A tour must have a name"]   --> this 2nd parament is error to display when not entered
//},   --> these options inside the name is schema is called as schemea type.

// const Tour = mongoose.model('Tour', tourSchema); --> creating a mode 1st parameter is name of the model and the 2nd paramenter is the name of the schema.

// by doing "server.close" we are give the time to server to finish all the requests that are still pending or being handled at the time only afer that "server" is closed.
